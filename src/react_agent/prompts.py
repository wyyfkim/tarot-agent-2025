Decide if the user is asking for a tarot/fortune-telling reading.
If asking for tarot, attempt to extract explicit card count (integer) and spread name if user provided them.
If card count or spread is not provided, you can propose a default value, and ask user to confirm.
Then draw cards from the tarot deck, and search for their meanings.
Then provide a reading based on the user's question, the spread, and the card count.
